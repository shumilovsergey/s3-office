S3-vibe Local File Host - CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

1. Docker Executor:
   - Uses python:3.11-slim as the base image
   - Lightweight and suitable for CI/CD pipelines

2. Pipeline Stages:
   - test: Runs tests when commit message contains "test" or "deploy"
   - deploy: Deploys the application when commit message contains "deploy"

3. Caching:
   - Caches pip packages to speed up builds
   - Caches virtual environment

4. Test Job:
   - Runs when commit message contains "test" or "deploy"
   - Uses pytest for testing
   - Tests basic application functionality

5. Deploy Job:
   - Runs only when commit message contains "deploy"
   - Deploys the application
   - Stores uploads and thumbnails as artifacts
   - Artifacts expire after 1 week

6. Basic Tests:
   - Tests the index page
   - Tests the upload endpoint with and without files
   - Tests file type validation

7. IP Whitelisting:
   - Restricts file access to whitelisted IP addresses
   - Supports both individual IPs and CIDR ranges
   - Configurable through config.py
   - Can be enabled/disabled with FILE_ACCESS_ENABLED setting
   - Logs access denied attempts

Usage Instructions:

For Testing Only:
- Commit with a message containing "test"
- Example: git commit -m "test: update UI components"

For Testing and Deployment:
- Commit with a message containing "deploy"
- Example: git commit -m "deploy: release v1.0.0"

The pipeline will automatically run the appropriate jobs based on your commit message.

IP Whitelisting Configuration:
- Edit config.py to add or remove IP addresses
- Use CIDR notation for IP ranges (e.g., '192.168.1.0/24')
- Set FILE_ACCESS_ENABLED = False to disable IP whitelisting
